## Notes

The overall process was challenging as I had previously worked with ios instead of Android. I'm still learning with Java so I tried to help myself in the best way possible. The videos CodePath provided were helpful in the process aside from some of the features being outdated. However, I had lots of difficulties throughout the process with certain functions and had to refer to other sources in order to receive help.
